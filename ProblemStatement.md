# ProblemStatement

## Problem Statement

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, countless individuals
aspire to transition into tech careers or upgrade their skills, but they
face an overwhelming paradox of choice. A marketing professional wanting
to become a data analyst, a college graduate aiming to learn web
development, or a working parent seeking to upskill---all encounter the
same frustrating roadblocks. They're bombarded with thousands of online
tutorials, courses, and resources, yet lack a clear, personalized
roadmap to guide them from where they are to where they want to be. This
information overload leads to analysis paralysis, wasted time
researching instead of learning, and ultimately, abandoned learning
journeys. The current self-education ecosystem lacks intelligent
curation and personalized sequencing, leaving learners to navigate a
maze of resources without a compass.

## Target Users

Our primary users are career changers, students, and self-learners who
feel lost in their skill development journey. These individuals span
various backgrounds---from complete beginners with zero technical
experience to intermediate learners stuck in "tutorial hell." They
include professionals seeking career transitions into tech fields,
students supplementing formal education, and employees upskilling to
remain competitive. What unites them is their desire for structure in an
unstructured learning environment and their need for a clear, achievable
path forward that respects their unique starting point and time
constraints.

## Pain Points

Learners today grapple with several critical challenges. First, they
face information overload---too many resources create confusion rather
than clarity. Second, they lack proper structure, jumping between
unrelated topics without meaningful progression. Third, they waste
precious hours researching what to learn next instead of actually
learning. Fourth, they struggle with skill gap identification, unsure
which competencies to prioritize for specific goals. Fifth, they
encounter inappropriate content levels, where beginners accidentally
dive into advanced materials. Sixth, they experience the frustration of
one-size-fits-all learning paths that don't account for their background
or availability. These pain points collectively create a barrier to
entry that discourages potential learners and reduces completion rates
for those who start.

## Why This Matters

This problem matters profoundly because it represents a significant
barrier to economic mobility and workforce development. Personalized
learning paths and curated learning can democratize tech education,
making high-paying careers accessible to people from diverse
backgrounds. Clear roadmaps increase efficiency, confidence, and
completion rates. Effective skill development systems reduce
unemployment, bridge the digital divide, and fuel innovation.

## MVP Goal

Our MVP aims to create an AI-powered learning assistant that generates
personalized 4--6 week roadmaps based on individual circumstances. It
takes user inputs---current skill level, background experience,
availability, and goals---and outputs structured learning plans with
milestones, curated resources, and time estimates. Success is measured
by completion rates, time savings, and user satisfaction.

## Scope (Included Features)

Core features include: a clean UI for collecting user details,
integration with AI to generate personalized paths, 4--6 week structured
roadmaps, curated resource suggestions, and local persistence using
localStorage. Tech stack: React + Tailwind frontend, Express.js backend,
Gemini AI integration, RESTful API design. Supported learning goals
include web development, data analysis, and Python.

## Out of Scope

Out-of-scope items include authentication, advanced progress tracking,
social features, payment systems, dynamic learning analytics, and
user-generated content systems. These are deferred to later phases to
keep the MVP focused.

## Assumptions

We assume users can self-assess their skill levels, 4--6 weeks is
optimal for structured learning, AI-generated paths will be accurate,
users have internet access, and selected learning goals are common. We
also assume the system can handle concurrent users and that AI responses
meet expectations.

## Success Vision

We aim to transform skill development into an accessible, guided journey
that removes friction and empowers individuals to succeed. By providing
structure and clarity, our solution helps learners progress confidently,
contributes to closing the global skills gap, and opens doors for
personal and professional growth.
